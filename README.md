Increasing network complexity—installing and managing new infrastructure, 
IoT, and changing user behavior—has left today’s network operators 
(and business leaders) overloaded, overwhelmed, and unable to enhance 
their end user’s experiences and elevate business outcomes. 
IT teams spend too much time on manual, day-to-day tasks, 
leaving no time to modernize the network, which leads to 
inefficiencies that affect the company’s bottom line.

Time-consuming, manual management
Network operators spend too much time and effort on network design and daily management, 
which prevents them from focusing on more strategic initiatives.

Lack of insights
IT teams must leverage disparate monitoring tools to manage increasingly complex networks 
and wade through copious amounts of data to derive insights, leading to reactive and 
costly troubleshooting.

HPE Aruba Networking offers a comprehensive set of AI networking features that provide
much-needed network visibility, automated workflows, and troubleshooting insights. 
From natural language search for Day 0 tasks to Day N network optimization 
recommendations, the AI solutions within HPE Aruba Networking Central 
reduce operational and consumption complexity.
